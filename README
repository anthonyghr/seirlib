Description
===========

This library is an incubator for testing epidemic models, specifically compartment models (see http://wiki.eclipse.org/Introduction_to_Compartment_Models)
The library is implemented in Clojure, but provides an API for Java code to use.

Usage
=====

The easiest way to use this library from Java is to generate a JAR file that can be included into your application.
1) Download Leiningen (https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen), placing the lein script in the path for easier use.
2) In the directory where you placed the downloaded seirlib code, type: lein uberjar
3) That's it! Place the generated jar (seirlib-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar) in your application path and your are good to go.

The testseirlib subdirectory contains a simple Java class demonstrating how the library can be used.
